A fully configurable proxy in NodeJS, which can handle HTTPS requests perfectly.

特性
------------
* 支持https明文代理
* 支持低网速模拟
* 全流程开放，可以用javascript控制代理流程中的任意步骤。搭建前端个性化调试环境的利器。
* 提供web版界面，供观测请求情况

Feature
------------
* work as http or https proxy
* fully configurable, you can modify a request at any stage by your own javascript code
* when working as https proxy, it can generate and intercept https requests for any domain without complaint by browser (after you trust its root CA)
* a web interface is availabe for you to view request details
* (beta)a web UI interface for you to replace some remote response with local data

Quick Start
--------------

### step 1 - install

* install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
* ``npm install -g anyproxy`` , may require ``sudo``
* python is optional, it will be OK if you get some error about it during installing.

### step 2 - start server

* start with default settings : ``anyproxy``
* start with a specific port:  ``anyproxy --port 8001``
* start with a rule file: ``anyproxy --rule ./rule_sample/rule_allow_CORS.js``

### step 3 - launch web interface

* visit [http://127.0.0.1:8002](http://127.0.0.1:8002) with modern browsers


Rule module
-------------------
* Rule module is the specialty for anyproxy. Unlike other proxy, here you could write your own code to hack requests at any stage, no matter it is about to response or the proxy just gets the request. In this way, it would be much more flexible to meet your own demands.

* It's highly recommended to read this guide before using: [What is rule file and how to write one ?](https://github.com/alibaba/anyproxy/wiki/What-is-rule-file-and-how-to-write-one)

* An entire scheme of rule file could be found at [./rule_sample/rule__blank.js](https://github.com/alibaba/anyproxy/blob/master/rule_sample/rule__blank.js). Besides, there are some samples at [./rule_sample](https://github.com/alibaba/anyproxy/tree/master/rule_sample). That may help you a lot when writing your own rule files.

Https features
----------------
After configuring rootCA, anyproxy could help to decrypt https requests, whose approach is also called Man-In-The-Middle(MITM).

#### step 1 - install openssl
* openssl is availabe here : [http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation](http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation) 
* using ``openssl version -a `` to make sure it is accessible via you command line.

#### step 2 - generate a rootCA and trust it
* execute ``sudo anyproxy --root``
* start anyproxy by ``anyproxy``, fetch rootCA.crt via http://localhost:8002/fetchCrtFile, then open and trust it.
* you should trust this rootCA on all of your clients.

#### to intercept(decrypt) https requests
* start your anyproxy by ``anyproxy --intercept``. When rootCA exists, it will intercept(decrypt) all the https requests for you.
* if you meet with a warning like 'unsafe connection', please check if the root CA is correctly trusted by your operation system.

#### to start an https proxy
* ``anyproxy --type https --host my.domain.com``
* the param ``host`` is required with https proxy and it should be kept exactly what it it when you config your browser. Otherwise, you may get some warning about security.
* using **https proxy** means your request towards proxy will be encrypted. Please notice that this feature has nothing to do with **intercept https requests**.

#### about certs
* root certs and temperary certs are stored at ``path.join(util.getUserHome(),"/.anyproxy_certs/")``
* to get the rootCA.crt file , you may either find it in local dir or download it via anyproxy web interface
* to clear all the temperary certificates ``anyproxy --clear``
* https features may be unstable in windows

Others
-----------------

#### to save request data 
* to save request data to local file, use ``` anyproxy --file /path/to/file ```
* anyproxy uses [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) to save request data. Since NeDB's persistence uses an append-only format, you may get some redundant record in local file. For those dupplicated ones with the same id, just use the lastest line of record.
* [TrafficeRecorder](https://github.com/ottomao/TrafficRecorder) is another tool based on anyproxy to help recording all request data, including header and body. You may have a try.

#### throttling
* for instance, ``` anyproxy --throttle 10 ``` sets the speed limit to 10kb/s (kbyte/sec)
* this is just a rough throttling for downstream, not for network simulation

#### work as a module for nodejs
* use it as a module and develop your own proxy.

```
npm install anyproxy --save
```

```javascript
var proxy = require("anyproxy");

//create cert when you want to use https features
//please manually trust this rootCA when it is the first time you run it
!proxy.isRootCAFileExists() && proxy.generateRootCA(); 

var options = {
    type          : "http",
    port          : 8001,
    hostname      : "localhost",
    rule          : require("path/to/my/ruleModule.js"),
    dbFile        : null,  // optional, save request data to a specified file, will use in-memory db if not specified
    webPort       : 8002,  // optional, port for web interface
    socketPort    : 8003,  // optional, internal port for web socket, replace this when it is conflict with your own service
    webConfigPort : 8088,  // optional, internal port for web config(beta), replace this when it is conflict with your own service
    throttle      : 10,    // optional, speed limit in kb/s 
    disableWebInterface : false //optional, set it when you don't want to use the web interface
};
new proxy.proxyServer(options);
